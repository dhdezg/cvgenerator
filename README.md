# CV Generator

![cv_generator_min](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b804442a-7e5c-414d-aa35-17807a317cda)

This project is based on a recent publication by the prestigious Harvard University, which talked about the best resume format for job offers. This publication talked about a serious and formal format, without colours or images, so as not to have problems with the filtering programmes to which resumes are subjected before reaching the human resources staff of the companies.

To help users to get this resume without worrying about the styles, I have developed this application using React and Javascript, in which through a series of steps they will fill in the most relevant information and finally they will be able to download their resume in PDF format, ready to deliver or print.

# For developers who want to contribute

Currently there are quite a few improvements that could be implemented in the application, you can download the repository, create a new branch for the development you want to do and open the Pull Request, when I have time I will review it, if there is no problem and I consider that it is a good implementation it will be approved and merge.

## 🛠️ Development Setup

### 🎨 Prettier in VS Code

To ensure consistent code formatting across the project, we recommend configuring **Prettier** as the default formatter in Visual Studio Code.

Follow these steps:

1. 🔍 Open the command palette:  
   `Ctrl + Shift + P` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd + Shift + P` (Mac)

5. 💾 Enable format on save:
